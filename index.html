			<p>Meals on Wheels of Hamilton County provides nutritious meals delivered to elderly, disabled and homebound residents either on a short-term or a long-term basis. Clients may be recovering from a hospital stay, an injury or a disabling illness. Meals are provided five days a week as long as necessary.</p>
	
			<h3>Eligibility Requirements</h3>
	
			<p>The service is available to anyone who is physically or mentally unable to prepare a meal for themselves regardless of age or income. Clients can refer themselves or be referred by their physician, a family member, church pastor, or hospital discharge personnel. Applications for home-delivered meals are reviewed and approved by the Executive Director. A doctor&rsquo;s script is required for every client receiving meals to insure that dietary restrictions are honored, and dietary requirements are met.</p>
	
			<blockquote>Can you donate the next meal? Help <a href="donate.html" title="Sponsor a senior today!">sponsor a senior</a> who is in need of covering the cost of daily meals.</blockquote>
	
			<h3>Food Preparation</h3>
	
			<p>Meals are prepared in approved institutional kitchens under the direct supervision of registered dietitians. Special dietary requirements can be accommodated such as a diabetic, heart healthy, low-fat/low-cholesterol, or renal diets for dialysis patients.</p>
	
			<p>Two meal plans are offered:</p>
	
			<ul>
				<li>A one-meal plan consists of a hot lunch in a three-compartment tray and includes a protein portion, a carbohydrate, and a vegetable. A separate cold sack accompanies the hot meal and provides bread and butter, dessert and a choice of milk or juice as a beverage.</li>
				<li>The two-meal plan consists of the same hot lunch, plus an additional deli-style sack supper that includes a protein sandwich, a fruit or dessert, and a second choice of milk or juice as a beverage.</li>
			</ul>
	
			<p>Menus are designed by the nutrition services staff at each of the meal preparation facilities and may rotate on a weekly or monthly basis. Personal preferences or substitutions may or may not be possible.</p>
	
			<h3>Payment for Meals</h3>
	
			<p>Clients are asked to pay for the cost of their meals and are invoiced at the end of each month for all the meals consumed in the previous month. Third-party payers on behalf of a client may include a relative, adult child, a friend/church member, or a private sponsor. Every effort is made to provide meals to clients regardless of their ability to pay. With the financial support of <abbr title="Central Indiana Council on Aging">CICOA</abbr> In-Home Aging Solutions and the Access Network, we are able to subsidize a portion or all of the meal cost for those who need assistance.</p>
