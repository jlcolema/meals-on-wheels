			<p>The success of Meals on Wheels of Hamilton County depends on the compassionate hearts and willingness to share time and resources from community-service-minded individuals, like you! We need your wheels and your friendly smiles.</p>

			<p>There are a number of service opportunities available:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Delivering meals, either as a driver or a companion navigator,</li>
				<li>Assisting with administrative tasks in our office,</li>
				<li>Serving on advisory committees,</li>
				<li>Assisting with fundraising events, and</li>
				<li>Serving on our Board of Directors</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Without the help of our army of volunteers, we could not do what we do for clients.</p>

			<p>Personal home delivery is an important part of our service to the client. You may be the only friendly face that the client sees on your delivery day. The fact that you care is as important as the food you deliver.</p>

			<p>Every new driver must be personally trained by the Executive Director or another seasoned volunteer driver. When you ride with another driver, you learn about the clients, their special needs, and have an opportunity to ask questions about your route. Our Services Coordinator schedules all new-driver orientations.</p>

			<h3>Delivery Driver Guidelines</h3>

			<p>Our primary need is for volunteer delivery drivers. We always need more people to help us deliver meals. If you are interested in becoming a delivery driver, there are a few simple requirements:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>A valid drivers license,</li>
				<li>Vehicle insurance information,</li>
				<li>A signed confidentiality agreement, and</li>
				<li>Pass a background check</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Corporations and small businesses who encourage their employees to participate in community service projects may be interested in our Adopt-A-Route program. If your business is willing to loan us your employees for a minimum of two hours per month, they can deliver meals in a geographic area that is close to your business. We will provide recognition and visibility to the community that your business cares enough to deliver Meals on Wheels in Hamilton County. Employees are given an extra hour of paid time off in conjunction with their lunch hour to pick up meals and deliver them to clients who are always happy to see them. Car magnets are custom made with your corporate or business logo and placed on the car doors while your employees are delivering meals.</p>

			<p>Anyone interested in volunteering must complete the <a href="" title="Volunteer Application Form">Volunteer Application form</a> and submit it to our office by e-mail, fax or mail.</p>
