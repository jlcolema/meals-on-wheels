			<p>There are several ways to support the mission of Meals on Wheels of Hamilton County. Financial support is always welcome. Many of our community&rsquo;s older citizens are nutritionally at risk and would benefit from home-delivered meals that will sustain good health. Unfortunately not all of our clients have the resources to pay for their meals. Many are living on very limited fixed incomes or have high medical prescription costs that compromise their ability to pay for meals. Here&rsquo;s how you can help!</p>

			<p>The Sponsor-A-Senior program gives you an opportunity to subsidize the cost of a nutritious meal and provide a friendly volunteer to check on the well-being of a client. For as little as $30 per week, you can provide two healthy meals per day and help us reduce hunger among the elderly, disabled and homebound residents in our community. <em>No amount is too small</em>. Just $6.00 will provide meal service for one day. A donation of $125 will provide meals for an entire month for one hungry client.</p>

			<p>We have made it easy for you to donate online with your personal credit card. If you prefer to make a monthly pledge, we will gladly charge your credit card for a specified amount every month, and provide a tax-deductible receipt. A one-time donation can also be made through our online payment system which will also generate a tax-deductible receipt. Of course, you can also send a donation by mail, if you prefer, to:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Meals on Wheels of Hamilton County</li>
				<li>395 Westfield Road</li>
				<li>Noblesville IN 46060-1425</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
			
			<p>Sometimes we forget that we can honor those we love by making a donation in their name or their memory, especially on special occasions. Please consider making a donation in someone&rsquo;s honor or memory the next time you are frustrated about shopping for an appropriate gift. We will send a letter to the person you wish to honor.</p>
			
			<p>If you have a will or estate plan, you can remember Meals on Wheels of Hamilton County as a favorite charity to continue your legacy of giving.</p>
			
			<p>Children have donated the change in their piggy banks, and others have saved the change from their pockets for a year and presented it to Meals on Wheels to sponsor meals for a client.</p>
			
			<p>If you make a donation, and your company will match it, that is another way to contribute.</p>
			
			<p>Gas cards make wonderful gifts for our dedicated volunteers who are using their own vehicles to deliver meals.</p>
			
			<p>We also have three levels of sponsorship opportunities for corporations and businesses to contribute to our special fundraising events twice a year.</p>
			
			<p>The possibilities are endless, and we are grateful for all the help we get. On behalf of our clients, we thank you for your generosity!</p>
